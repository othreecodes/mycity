You're required to build a simple form submitting and retrieval web app.

The app should basically consist of 3-5 pages at most.
Page 1 should consist of a form with the following fields:- First name, last name,
address, phone number,
passport photograph(image upload field), item view(image field).

When the user submits the form after filling the
fields(all fields must be filled and image upload fields must be an image
resized to a maximum of size of 580 x 450) they should have a confirmation
message with a return to form link.

Now on that first page there should be a search box at top right corner.
A visitor to the page can either decide to submit information or simply use the
search box to search submitted information using the phone number.
When a user queries using the phone number or any number similar to that phone number,
it should bring out all records(images inclusive) that have that phone number or similar to that.
